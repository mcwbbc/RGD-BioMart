Episodes last from 15-60 minutes and typically occur after a period of rest following exercise. A defect in skeletal muscle sodium channels has been identified as the cause of this condition. Normokalemic periodic paralysis is a closely related disorder marked by a lack of alterations in potassium levels during attacks of weakness.

The juvenile form presents with lactic acidosis, alopecia, intermittent ATAXIA, SEIZURES, and an erythematous rash. (From J Inherit Metab Dis 1996;19(4):452-62) Autosomal recessive and X-linked forms are caused by mutations in the genes for the three different enzyme components of this multisubunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. One of the mutations at Xp22.2-p22.1 in the gene for the E1 alpha component of the complex leads to LEIGH DISEASE." [MESH:D018214]

Common conditions associated with nerve injury include INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; CRANIOCEREBRAL TRAUMA; ISCHEMIA; and INFRATENTORIAL NEOPLASMS." [MESH:D018214]

Protein deficiency may also arise in the face of adequate protein intake if the protein is of poor quality (i.e., the content of one or more amino acids is inadequate and thus becomes the limiting factor in protein utilization).

Opsoclonus refers to rapid, conjugate oscillations of the eyes in multiple directions, which may occur as a parainfectious or paraneoplastic condition (e.g., OPSOCLONUS-MYOCLONUS SYNDROME).

Pathologic features include diffuse demyelination and metachromatically-staining granules within glial cells, macrophages, and free in tissue. Clinical subtypes include late infantile, juvenile, and adult forms. The late infantile form presents at 12-18 months of age with progressive psychomotor retardation, ATAXIA, spasticity, and OPTIC ATROPHY. The juvenile form has onset at 4-12 years and features behavioral alterations and ataxia followed by spasticity, DEMENTIA, and visual loss. The adult form presents in the second decade or later with psychiatric manifestations, gait difficulties, and less often as a peripheral neuropathy.
