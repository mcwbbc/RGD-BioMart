RGD Rat BioMart README

Purpose:
To provide an automated script that would rebuild a new RatMart as data was 
published by the Rat Genome Database (RGD).

Use:
In the rgd directory:

perl mcwRGDUpdate.pl 

or 

perl mcwRGDUpdate.pl new

The new argument is used either for an initial build or to force a rebuild, otherwise
the script will automatically terminate unless it finds new data.

Requirements:
BioMart and all associated requirements
And the following Perl modules
- LWP::UserAgent
- DBI
- DBD for your database

You should also create the following two databases (using BioMart's naming conventions):
rgd__mart
rgd_temp__mart

Configuring the scripts:
DNINFO.pm
You will need to rename DBINFO.pm.example to DBINFO.pm and update the file
with your database information.

RBC.pm
If you are using a system that supports sendmail you can add your administrators email
addresses to the @emails array.  If your system does not support sendmail all messages
will be sent via STDOUT.

Data and Files:
The script automatically downloads most of the information that is required, however there
are two files included rgd_goslim.txt and rgd_do_obo.txt that are currently not publically
available and necessary to build the Rat BioMart.

The script also creates two files RGDdate and RGDindex which are used to store information;
RGDdate, for example, contains the date of the last RGD FTP downloaded and compares that to
the date on the current file to determine if a rebuild is necessary.
